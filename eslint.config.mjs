  // line shows the unchanged closing brace as removed and re-added, and hands its blame to whoever

  // rather than starting a reformat — two files had drifted in an in-flight PR, which is what
  // showed there was nothing holding it.
  //
  // **It reaches 522 of the 539 files `git ls-files` reports**, and the gap is worth knowing rather
  // than closing here. One of the seventeen is the deliberate `typeAssertions.ts` exclusion above.
  // The other sixteen are nobody's decision: `playground/` and `docs/` have no `lint` script; each
  // package lints `src` only, so the `vitest.config.ts` files and `vitest.shared.ts` sit outside;
  // and the `**/*.mjs` ignore catches `postcss.config.mjs`, one agent script, and **this file** —
  // `!scripts/**` is anchored at the root, so it never reaches `packages/*/scripts/`. All seventeen
  // comply today, and nothing holds them there.
  //
  // Deprecated in core since 8.53 and **removed in 11.0.0**, which is the next major rather than a
  // distant one — the version is in the rule's own metadata. ESLint does report the use, in
  // `usedDeprecatedRules`; the stylish formatter this repo runs simply does not print it, so a
  // quiet `pnpm lint` is not evidence the rule is current. The migration is the `@stylistic/eol-last`
  // rule, which comes from the `@stylistic/eslint-plugin` package — a whole plugin as a new
  // dependency for one rule, and not worth adding before the upgrade needs it.
