// tapflow — tell an iOS simulator's app that it is off the network (#607).
//
// The simulator has no NIC to attach a shaper to: it is native processes on the host kernel sharing
// the host's network stack, so Network Link Conditioner, `dnctl`, and every other traffic-shaping
// route reach the whole Mac or nothing. Apple ships no per-simulator conditioning API — checked
// across `simctl`, CoreSimulator's private selectors and the runtime itself on Xcode 26.6.
//
// **Blocking the traffic is not this file's job.** The host content filter (`ios-netfilter`) drops
// the flows of one simulator at the kernel. What no host-side filter can do is change what the app
// *believes*: an app reads `nw_path_get_status` inside its update handler, the real path never
// changed — the Mac is still on Wi-Fi — so the handler never fires again and the offline banner
// never appears. Measured: traffic dead, `path=satisfied` for the life of the process. That half
// needs a hook inside the app, and it is what remains here.
//
// **Inline patching, because neither of the pointer-rewriting techniques reaches.** dyld's
// `__DATA,__interpose` does not fire in a real `.app`, and fishhook — which rewrites indirect symbol
// pointers — reaches only images outside the dyld shared cache, where every system framework calls
// its neighbours with direct branches. Both were measured here, and fishhook's apparent success was
// this dylib's own imports being rebound, which is also what made the first self-check pass while
// nothing was blocked. `inline-hook.c` patches the target function's body instead.
//
// This is deliberately a **QA instrument that lies to one app**, so everything here is built around
// one question: can it lie *silently*? A hook that does not install produces a false QA result —
// someone signs off "offline handling works" on an app that was never offline. `rebind_symbols`
// returns 0 whether or not it rebound anything, so nothing here trusts that it worked;
// `tf_self_check` proves it by trying.

/**
 * The dylib is delivered simulator-wide (`launchctl setenv DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`), so it loads in
 * every process in the simulator — SpringBoard, backboardd, the lot — and the defence is **this
 * function, not the delivery**. Anything not recognised gets no hooks at all.
 *
 * **The reason originally given for that breadth has been measured false.** It said simulator-wide
 * delivery was the only way to reach an app's WebView, `WebKit.Networking` being a sibling process
 * under `launchd_sim` that `SIMCTL_CHILD_…` could not follow. The sibling part is true; the reach is
 * not. Measured 2026-08-23 with an app holding a real `WKWebView`: `WebKit.Networking`,
 * `WebKit.WebContent` and `WebKit.GPU` all spawned, and **not one of them loaded this library** —
 * they are restricted enough that dyld drops `DYLD_*`. Ordinary daemons in the same simulator loaded
 * it in the same run, so the delivery itself works.
 *
 * **The `com.apple.WebKit.` branch that measurement made dead is gone** (#635), and with it the only
 * reason this file ever had two kinds of activated process. What is left is one: the target app.
 *
 * **A hybrid app's web half is therefore not told it is offline**, and that is a limitation rather
 * than a bug to find later. Its traffic is still blocked — the host content filter works at the
 * kernel, for every process — so a `fetch` inside the web view fails. What it does not get is the
 * path status, so a WebView that renders its own offline banner from `navigator.onLine` will not
 * show it. Nothing in this process can reach that one.
 *
 * **Simulator-wide delivery stays, on a different reason than it was chosen for.** The WebView reach
 * is gone, but the breadth still buys the case per-launch environment cannot: a tester who taps the
 * app's icon on the springboard, rather than launching it through tapflow, gets a hooked app.
 * `simctl launch --env` would cover only the launches tapflow itself performs, and a manual relaunch
 * mid-session is ordinary. The cost is that this is the mechanism that could take a whole simulator
 * down at once, which is why the gate below refuses by default.
 *
 * **The default is off.** With no target named, or no bundle identifier to compare, this returns
 * false: a bug in the identification leaves the simulator unhooked rather than hooking the system.

/**
 * Prove the hooks took — **through the API the app uses, never through our own imports**.
 *
 * The first version of this called `connect()` from inside this dylib. That is the one binding a
 * symbol-rebinding hook is guaranteed to catch, so it reported success while real `URLSession`
 * traffic went completely unhooked, and every judgement built on that was wrong. The technique has
 * changed and the trap has not: a probe that exercises our own call sites measures our own call
 * sites.
 *
 * So this drives the stack a real app drives — a real `nw_path_monitor`, which must report
 * `unsatisfied` — with this process forced offline, so the verdict is about the hooks and not about
 * the condition file.
 *
 * **One assertion, deliberately, and the missing one is not an omission.** This used to also require
 * `-1009` from a `URLSession` against a documentation address (RFC 5737 TEST-NET-3), which is what a
 * hooked `connect` yielded. That hook is gone — traffic is the content filter's job now — and no
 * honest in-process replacement exists for it:
 *
 *  - the filter runs on the host, so nothing here can force it on for one process the way
 *    `g_forced_offline` does, and a probe that needed the real toggle would report on the tester's
 *    current state rather than on the hooks
 *  - `getaddrinfo` is still hooked, but its effect cannot be told apart from an unhooked stack
 *    without real DNS traffic: a name that resolves to nothing (`.invalid`, RFC 2606) fails with
 *    `-1003` either way, and a name that does resolve means this self-check phones a real host on
 *    every app launch. The rule this file lives by is *require the specific failure, not any
 *    failure* — for that hook the specific failure is unobservable, so nothing is claimed about it
 *
 * It is still installed, and the install itself is verified: `wanted[]` is all-or-none, so a refused
 * `getaddrinfo` fails the whole install before this runs. What is not verified here is its *effect*.
 * The other half of the feature — that traffic is actually blocked — is verified where it can be, by
 * the agent against the content filter, and reported through `NetworkState`.

 * It is written on **every** launch, including a failing one: an absent file and a failing one mean
 * different things, and only one of them is "no app has run yet".
 *
 * **Written beside the target and renamed onto it, never written in place.** `fopen(path, "w")`
 * truncates the file the agent may be reading at that instant. It reads this on every `state()`,
 * which the relay triggers on `device:ready`, on a viewer's re-join and after every toggle — so a
 * read landing inside the write is reachable on a completely healthy session, and what it gets is a
 * truncated file. The reader cannot tell that from an answer, so a working app reported
 * `state-unconfirmed` for no reason (#653). `rename(2)` within one filesystem is atomic: a reader
 * sees the whole old file or the whole new one and never a piece of either.
 *
 * The pid is in the temp name because two processes can be writing one udid's verdict — a relaunched
 * app races its own predecessor — and a shared temp path would put them back in each other's way.
 *
 * **Nothing collects a temp file left by a process that died between the `fopen` and the `rename`,**
 * and that is a decision rather than an oversight. The reader opens the exact verdict path, so a
 * stray `…json.<pid>.tmp` is inert; the simulator's `/tmp` is cleaned by macOS; and a collector here
 * would have to guess which of them belongs to a process still running.

// ── reachability: the other API an app asks "am I online?" ───────────────────
//
// **The path set does not cover `SCNetworkReachability`, and that was measured rather than assumed.**
// SystemConfiguration's modern implementation sits on Network.framework but reaches it through the
// `nw_path_create_evaluator_for_*` family rather than `nw_path_get_status`, so the hook that already
// fakes the path for `NWPathMonitor` leaves this API answering truthfully. Alamofire's
// `NetworkReachabilityManager` and the older `Reachability.swift` both read it, so an app built on
// either showed no offline banner at all.
//
// **Five hooks, and none of them is the optional one.**
//
//   `GetFlags`          — what a poll returns.
//   `SetCallback`       — **what a consumer actually reads.** These libraries do not poll: they
//                         register a callback, cache what it last said, and recompute only inside it.
//                         Measured with `netprobe/` before this existed: the getter flipped within one
//                         tick while the listener sat on `reachable` for the whole offline period.
//   `SetDispatchQueue`  — where a replayed callback is allowed to run (#640).
//   `ScheduleWithRunLoop` / `UnscheduleFromRunLoop`
//                       — the same question for a consumer that uses a run loop instead.
//
// **The app's callout is wrapped rather than registered, and the reason is narrower than it looks.**
// An earlier version handed the app's own function straight to `SCNetworkReachabilitySetCallback`,
// and a review predicted that the framework's own callbacks would then arrive unmasked — breaking the
// case a tester reaches first: take a device offline, *then* launch the app, where
// `tf_start_watching` records `last = tf_offline()` at start and so never pushes.
//
// **Measured, that does not happen**: with only the getter patched, SC's registration callback in that
// exact scenario carried `flags=0x0`, not the real ones. The inference — not verified beyond the
// measurement — is that SC computes the flags it delivers through the public getter this file
// patches. So the prediction was wrong and the trampoline fixes no reproduced defect.
//
// It is kept for the weaker reason that survives: **that behaviour is an undocumented internal.**
// Nothing promises SC will keep routing its own notifications through the public entry point, there is
// no CI for any of this (`AGENTS.md`), and the failure if it changes is silent — a consumer told it is
// online while its traffic is dead, which is the one direction this whole feature exists to prevent.
// The trampoline makes the masking happen in one place that cannot stop being on the path. The cost is
// one `dispatch_sync` per callback, and it is recorded here rather than argued as a bug fix.
//
// **All-or-none within this set, and it additionally requires the path set.** The path set is
// interdependent on its own terms; the same holds inside this one. What does not hold is the reverse:
// if these three cannot be patched, an `NWPathMonitor` app still gets a correct banner and an SC app
// is left where it was. That is why they are two sets rather than one — but the dependency that does
// exist runs one way and is enforced below, because these replacements read `tf_blocking`.
