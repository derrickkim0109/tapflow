   * the list already said `booted`, precisely so this sentence stays true. So a `shutdown` reading

   * would end early is indistinguishable from a slow machine's, the 3s answered no measurement, and

   * **A failed reading is not a reading.** `listDevices` spawns `xcrun simctl list`, and this does
   * it up to `timeoutMs / pollIntervalMs` times where the old code did it once — every one an
   * independent chance to kill a healthy boot, during the interval when CoreSimulator is busiest.
   * Failures are swallowed and retried, and the last one is reported with the deadline so the cause
   * is not lost. Android's poll has always done this (`EmulatorLauncher.waitForBoot`); the first
   * draft of this method did not, which made the "counterpart" claim false in the one way that
   * matters.

   * `listDevices` is otherwise untimed: a wedged CoreSimulatorService would park the loop inside one
   * `xcrun` and the deadline below would never be consulted again. Bounding the reading is what makes
   * the deadline a deadline; swallowing the failure is what stops it ending the boot.
   *
   * `isStale` is checked every iteration. This loop outlives the boot that started it — the handler
   * is fire-and-forget, and its `bootSeq` check runs only once the wait *returns* — so a shutdown
   * arriving mid-wait would otherwise leave a poll spawning a process twice a second for the rest
   * of the deadline, against a device that is now deliberately off and therefore never converges.
