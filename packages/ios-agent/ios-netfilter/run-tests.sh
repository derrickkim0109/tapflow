# The netfilter's Swift tests (#690). Needs a full Xcode — not Command Line Tools, which has no
# `PlatformPath` and so no XCTest to link against. It runs no `xcodegen`; `tests.yml` is for
# opening these in Xcode, and `--print-sources` below is what keeps the two honest.
#
# **CI runs `--mutate`, not the plain mode.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` has a `test-swift` job on
# `macos-15` that calls this script with the flag, and it is part of the `ci` rollup — so a Mac
# contributor is no longer the only thing standing between a decorative test and a merge. Running the
# expensive mode there is deliberate: a green suite is not evidence on its own, and the whole reason
# this file exists is that the cheap mode cannot tell the difference.
#
# **That makes every mutation added below a cost paid on every push**, so the engine matters more
# than the count. It is `swiftc` plus `xcrun xctest`, not `xcodebuild`: measured on these same files,
# a build-and-run cycle is 1.9s against ~13.5s for one `xcodebuild test` launch on CI's runner. At
# eighty-three cycles that is the difference between eighteen minutes and three.
#
# **An earlier version of this header said CI could not run these at all**, which was true when it
# was written and stopped being true without anything here noticing.
#
#   ./run-tests.sh            run them
#   ./run-tests.sh --mutate   run them, then re-run under mutations that must make them FAIL
#
# The second mode is the point. `contributing/test-and-guard-coverage.md` rule 2: a test asserting
# absence passes when nothing happens, so a green run is not evidence it holds anything. The mutations
# below break the parse in the ways the tests claim to catch; any that still passes is decoration.

# `find` rather than a glob. `Tests/*.swift` does not descend, and `tests.yml` names the `Tests`

#   BUILD BROKE   — it did not compile, so no test ever judged it. Reporting this as `killed` is how a
