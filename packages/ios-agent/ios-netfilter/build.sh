# **The extension keeps its version when nothing about the extension changed** (#724).
#
# OSSystemExtension compares versions: a new number makes macOS replace the running provider, which
# interrupts every new connection on the Mac until the replacement is up. Three of the six rebuilds
# so far touched nothing but `Host/`, and each one paid that for nothing. The helper answers with the
# version the committed app already declares when the extension's inputs are unchanged, and with
# nothing when they are not — in which case both halves take the same fresh epoch, exactly as before.
#
# Silence is the safe answer: an unnecessary replace costs seconds, while reusing a version for an
# extension that *did* change is a replace macOS skips SILENTLY, leaving users on the old provider
# with every check green. See project.yml.
#
# **The helper always exits 0 and answers on stdout, so an empty answer is the only fallback path.**
# It catches its own failures deliberately: a probe that cannot run is doubt, and doubt mints a fresh
# version here rather than stopping a release. It says which on stderr — a silent probe failure and a
# real change produce the same stdout, so without that line this mechanism can stop working with no
# symptom but replaces coming back.
#
# `FORCE_EXT_BUMP=1` is the escape hatch for what the helper cannot see: the sysext embeds a
# provisioning profile and a Developer ID signature that live on this Mac, not in the repo. Renewing
# the profile changes the shipped extension with no file here moving, and a reused version would then
# be skipped on every Mac that already has it. Set it when the signing material changed.

# **The record and the artifact are written together on purpose.** `scripts/__tests__/` fails when the
# extension's sources move without the app moving with them, and a record written by a separate,
# remembered command would fail in a way correlated with the mistake it exists to catch: whoever
# forgets the rebuild forgets the record, both stay consistent, and the guard passes.
# `rm -rf` first: `ditto` **merges** into an existing destination and deletes nothing, so a rebuild
# that drops a file leaves it behind inside a sealed bundle — a stray `.systemextension` after a
# bundle-id change, an `embedded.provisionprofile` after the profile goes. `codesign --verify`
# then fails on the user's Mac, and the freshness guard cannot see it: it hashes the merged tree
# and records that, so the record is perfectly consistent with itself. Line 31 above already does
# this for the same reason.
