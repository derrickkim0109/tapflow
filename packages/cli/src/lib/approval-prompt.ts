/**
 * The terminal's half of `followThroughApproval`, in one place because two commands use it.
 *
 * `net-filter.ts` takes these as parameters rather than importing a prompt library, so the module that
 * runs the installer stays free of anything that reads a keyboard, and its tests can hand the flow a
 * person who answers yes or no.
 *
 * **A cancelled prompt is reported as such, not as a no.** Ctrl-C or Esc answers clack's cancel symbol,
 * and in raw mode no SIGINT reaches the process, so this answer is the only trace of someone backing
 * out. The question asked before the install has to stop on it — a no there still installs — and the
 * one asked after reads it as a no, since the install has already run.
