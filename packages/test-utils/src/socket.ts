/** What a caller gets back when it does not name a richer type: loose enough to index.
 *
 *  Kept as the **default**, and no longer as the **constraint** — those are different jobs and conflating them
 *  is what #505 broke. Messages became named interfaces, which have no implicit index signature, so no protocol
 *  type satisfies `Record<string, unknown>`. Every call site that named a type passed `RelayMessage`, itself a
 *  named interface, so every one of them violated the constraint — invisibly, because `src/__tests__` sat
 *  outside every tsconfig. Measured at the time #422 turned the checker on: 49. The looseness had stopped
 *  accommodating the richer views and started blocking them.
 *
 *  This file's own note said fixing it meant bringing the test tree into a tsconfig first, "which is a separate
 *  job" — #422 is that job, and this is the first thing it found. */

/**
 * Order-proof socket helpers for tapflow tests.
 *
 * **Why these exist rather than a `ws.once('message')` in each file.** The obvious shape —
 * "attach a listener, wait for the message" — only works if you attach before the message is sent.
 * Get the order wrong and nothing tells you: the listener sits on a reply that already went past,
 * and the test dies on a timeout pointing at the assertion instead of the cause. That mistake
 * happened three times in one branch (#452), twice with a correct example a few lines above.
 *
 * So these record instead of listening. From the moment a socket is opened, every message it
 * receives is either handed to a waiter or kept, and `waitForType` looks in the recording first.
 * Asking after the fact works exactly like asking before it:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const ws = new WebSocket(url)
 * await waitForOpen(ws)
 * ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'device:boot', requestId, ... }))   // required, or the relay drops it
 * await waitForType(ws, 'device:ready')   // fine whether it has landed yet or not
 * ```
 *
 * Matched messages are removed from the recording, so two waits for the same type see two
 * different messages.
 *
 * **This is a queue, not a broadcast.** The old per-call listeners each saw every message, so two
 * concurrent waits for one type both resolved from a single message. Here a message goes to
 * exactly one waiter. Two consequences worth knowing:
 *
 * - A pending {@link waitForMessage} (which matches any type) takes the next message even if a
 *   {@link waitForType} for that exact type is also waiting. Register the specific one first, or
 *   do not mix them on a socket where it matters.
 * - A {@link waitForTypeOrNull} that times out leaves nothing behind, but a message arriving after
 *   that goes into the recording and will answer a later wait on the same socket. That is usually
 *   what you want; it is surprising if you expected the timeout to have consumed it.
