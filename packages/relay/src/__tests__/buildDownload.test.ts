// The relay hands an agent a ticket instead of its own filesystem path, and serves the build against
// that ticket. Two things here are easy to get wrong and invisible to a unit test:
//
//   - **The route has to be reachable.** `:id` compiles to `([^/]+)` and the router returns on the
//     first registered match, so a download path under `/api/v1/builds/` is swallowed by
//     `/api/v1/builds/:id`. A test that calls the handler directly cannot see that.
//   - **An unmatched `/api/` GET is not a 404.** It falls through to the SPA fallback and comes back
//     **200 with `index.html`**, so asserting on the status code would let the collision through.
//     These tests assert on the bytes.
