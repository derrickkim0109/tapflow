/**
 * Single-use, short-lived credentials that let an agent download one build over HTTP.
 *
 * **Why a ticket rather than a scope on the agent's PAT.** The relay used to hand the agent its own
 * filesystem path and let it open the file, which works only when the two share a disk. Opening
 * `/uploads/` to the `agent` scope would have given every agent token the whole upload directory,
 * and a `builds/:id` route reachable with that scope gives it the whole builds table one row at a
 * time — the id is chosen by whoever calls. A ticket is minted where session ownership has *already*
 * been checked, so the permission is the one build that request is about.
 *
 * It also removes an authentication problem rather than adding one: `tapflow start` runs an agent on
 * loopback with **no token at all** (the relay accepts loopback agents unauthenticated), so any
 * design that required a PAT would have broken every all-in-one install.
 *
 * **What is actually enforced**, stated exactly because the previous draft claimed more: 32 bytes of
 * entropy, one use, one build, and `TICKET_TTL_MS`. There is no binding to a particular agent — the
 * relay does not record the agent socket's address, so it cannot check one at HTTP time, and a field
 * that looks like a check but is not is worse than its absence.
