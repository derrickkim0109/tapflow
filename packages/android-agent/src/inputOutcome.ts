/**
 * What happened to a terminal input, in the vocabulary the ack speaks.
 *
 * `dispatched: boolean` cannot express this. Android answers five failures that are neither "no
 * channel" nor "not booted": an input we do not implement on the path in use, a dispatch that
 * errored on a healthy channel, a session this agent does not know, a message that did not carry
 * what the input needs, and a terminal frame with no gesture behind it. Collapsing any of them into
 * the two messages `ackInput` used to own would report `input channel not ready` for a perfectly
 * healthy channel, which is the same class of lie this exists to remove (#482 / #484).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT identical to the iOS vocabulary — but not entirely by choice, and the difference
 * is worth stating honestly:
 *
 * - `unsupported` for an unmapped button IS a decision. iOS answers success there because its
 *   unmapped case means the device genuinely has no such button (#484); ours means we do not know
 *   the name.
 * - `no-session` is NOT a platform difference — it was an asymmetry, and it is now closed. iOS's four
 *   terminal handlers used to `break` silently on a missing state; they answer the same situation as
 *   of #490, mapped to the same wire reason our `wireReason()` maps it to.
 *
 * `not-booted` and `channel-down` keep their original wording, so the part that does overlap stays
 * symmetric — though note our `channel-down` is narrower than iOS's, because the situations iOS
 * folds into it get their own reasons above.

/**
 * The internal reason mapped onto the wire's closed set (`@tapflowio/protocol`).
 *
 * The wire set is smaller than this one. It is derived from what a *consumer* must do
 * differently, and two of our reasons ask for the same thing:
 *
 * - `no-gesture` passes through: it earned its own wire reason because the advice differs from
 *   `malformed`. The message was well-formed and the channel may be healthy — the caller re-opens the
 *   gesture rather than giving up.
 * - `no-session` → `channel-unavailable`: the consumer's move is the same (re-join or re-boot), and
 *   promoting it to its own wire reason would add a surface whose reachability is disputed —
 *   `sessionRebind.test.ts` records that a restarted agent is re-seeded from `agent:registered`,
 *   though that message carries one entry per *device* while one device can now sit behind two
 *   sessions. iOS answers this the same way, so the agents do not differ here.
 *
 * `channel-starting` has no producer here. iOS has a measured window where its helper is up but not
 * yet injecting; the Android paths either have a channel or do not. Recorded rather than left blank
 * so the gap is a fact about the platform and not an oversight.
