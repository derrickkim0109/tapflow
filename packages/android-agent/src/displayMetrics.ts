 * `REVERSE_LANDSCAPE` while Android has rotated the screen back to 0 — so a coordinate map built on
 * it is right unfolded and wrong folded. The two agreed until a foldable made them disagree.

/**
 * The rounded-corner radius, in device pixels, of the panel with these natural dimensions.
 *
 * **Read from Android rather than measured off the picture.** `detectCornerRadius` finds the run of
 * black down the frame's left edge, which is the radius only while the frame is upright — and the
 * emulator's capture is a quarter turn from the screen, so on a foldable it measured a side that
 * has no corner on it. Android already knows the number.
 *
 * Folding swaps to a different panel with a different curve: measured on a Pixel 9 Pro Fold, 85px
 * on the 2076-wide inner display and 115px on the 1080-wide cover, so 4.1% becomes 10.6%. The size
 * is what picks between them, because `dumpsys display` lists every panel whether it is on or not.
 *
 * **Returns device pixels, not a fraction.** It used to divide by the panel's natural width, which
 * is the wrong basis the moment the display is rotated: the corner is a physical property of the
 * panel and does not move, but the width the viewer scales it against is the *shown* width, which
 * swaps. Folded and turned to landscape, a cover panel's 115px over 1080 came out 2.24x too round.
 * Matching a panel still uses the natural size, because that is how `dumpsys` lists them — keeping
 * the match and the normalisation on one basis is what produced the bug.
 *
 * Returns null when no panel matches, which leaves the caller's existing value alone rather than
 * flattening the corners to square.
