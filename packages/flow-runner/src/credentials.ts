/**
 * Where a client's token comes from, and how a rotated one reaches a process that is already running (T1).
 *
 * The token used to be read once, from `TAPFLOW_TOKEN`, so replacing it meant re-registering the MCP server. Now a
 * client resolves it **explicit first** (`--token`, then a non-empty `TAPFLOW_TOKEN`) **and then a credentials
 * file**, and a request the relay refuses with 401 re-reads the file and is retried once — rotating a token is then
 * "write the file".
 *
 * - **The file is the user's, on the machine that runs the client** — `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tapflow/credentials.json`,
 *   else `~/.config/tapflow/credentials.json`, or `TAPFLOW_TOKEN_FILE`. Never the relay's `tapflow.config.json` or
 *   `<dataDir>/.env`: those belong to the relay host, and the person running a coding agent often has no relay.
 * - **Keyed by relay origin**, so a token minted on one relay is never sent to another. Loopback hosts on the same
 *   port share a key: `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` and `[::1]` reach the same listener.
 * - **An explicit token is never replaced by the file.** It is what the person asked for; a refusal says so and
 *   points at the file instead.
 * - **Opt-in.** Reading the file is `resolveToken`, never a side effect of constructing a client — a third party
 *   using `RelayClient` with its own token must not have a file's token sent on its behalf.
