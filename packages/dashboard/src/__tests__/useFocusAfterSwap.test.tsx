/**
 * **The hook's contract, held where every branch of it can be reached.**
 *
 * `AppCenter.switch.test.tsx` holds the page, including its one removal-without-a-swap (a row's
 * status being picked). What the page has no way to arrange — a control kept across a swap, a focus
 * dropped by hand in the same commit as a swap, a portal owned by content that is swapped out — is
 * arranged here, where the view the hook keys on and the content that is rendered are separate props.
 * The nine pages still to move off fetch-in-effect will each bring their own views, so the cases
 * below are the ones a mutation of the hook has to fail on, measured one condition at a time.
