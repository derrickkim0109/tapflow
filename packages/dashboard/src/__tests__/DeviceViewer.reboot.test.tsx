// **The wiring, which the hook's suite and the toolbar's suite cannot reach between them** (#628).
//
// `useDeviceReboot` is tested against a handler it registers itself, and `SimulatorToolbar` is tested
// with a stand-in `onReboot`. Between the two sits the chain that actually makes a device restart:
// `DeviceViewer` routes `device:shutdown-*` into a ref, hands `rebootPending`/`onReboot` down through
// `commonProps`, and — the half that exists nowhere else — turns the hook's completion into a
// `device:boot` through the same helper the join and the rebind use.
//
// Deleting the routing branch leaves `inboundDisposition` green: its check looks for a `.type`
// comparison against the literal in a file named in `at:`, which the branch's own condition satisfies
// whether or not it forwards anything. Its comment calls that a floor rather than a fence, and this
// is the fence. The harness is `DeviceViewer.network.test.tsx`'s, which exists for the same reason.
