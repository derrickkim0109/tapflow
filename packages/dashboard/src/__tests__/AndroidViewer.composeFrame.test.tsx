/**
 * **What a recorded frame is turned by, while it is being recorded.**
 *
 * `composeFrame` draws each recorded frame into the record canvas and reads the turn *per frame*
 * rather than inferring it from the canvas — an aspect ratio cannot tell 90 from 270 and cannot
 * see 180 at all. That is the whole reason `AndroidViewer` mirrors `totalTurn` and
 * `streamRotation` into refs: `MediaRecorder` took `composeFrame` when recording started, and a
 * rotation after that has to reach the frames anyway.
 *
 * None of it was covered. `composeFrame` and `startClientRecording` appeared in no test in this
 * package, so rotating mid-recording — an ordinary thing to do while testing — was held by nothing.
 * It is held here because the mirroring is what the React Compiler refuses to compile, and any
 * rewrite of it has to keep this true.
 *
 * **What this file does not hold: that registration is a layout effect rather than a passive one.**
 * The production comment gives a measured reason — `requestAnimationFrame` fires between the
 * layout effects and the paint, so a passive effect would draw the first frame after a rotation
 * with the old turn — and nothing here can fail if that changes. Every point these tests act at is
 * inside `act()`, which flushes passive effects synchronously, so jsdom cannot tell the two apart.
 * Holding it would mean ordering rAF against React's passive flush, which jsdom does not model;
 * that is a decision to take deliberately rather than a missing assertion. Recorded because a
 * green suite beside a stated reason reads as having held it.
