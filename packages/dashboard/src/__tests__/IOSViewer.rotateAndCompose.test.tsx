/**
 * **The iOS half of the recording and rotation contract.**
 *
 * `IOSViewer` took the same two changes `AndroidViewer` did — the recorder is handed its composer
 * through `setComposeFrame` instead of through `startClientRecording`, and the cleanup that puts a
 * rotated simulator back upright keeps its body in a ref so its dependency list is honestly empty.
 * Neither was held by anything: `input:rotate` appeared in no test in this package, and the four
 * files that render this component through `DeviceViewer` never record.
 *
 * Both mutations were measured green across all 681 tests before this file existed. The second is
 * the worse one, and it is this branch that made it quiet: `startClientRecording(composeFrame)`
 * used to require the composer, so losing it was a type error. Now a cleanup pass that deletes the
 * registration effect and its unused destructure leaves a green typecheck, a silent lint, and a
 * recording of a black canvas.
