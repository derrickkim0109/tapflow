 *
 * **Silence is still a reachable answer, not a hang to be defended against.** Both agents now answer a
 * shutdown they could not confirm with `device:shutdown-error` (#455), but an agent from before that
 * change answers a failed one with nothing at all, and the relay and agents are upgraded separately.
 * A `simctl shutdown` that hangs is silent on every version. So without this the control can still spin
 * for the rest of the session on a shutdown nobody will answer.
 *
 * 20s because the agent awaits the real shutdown before answering — `simctl shutdown` on a busy Mac,

 * current state: Booted` on purpose. Only `full-erase` shuts the device down first, and a reboot is
 * not a request to erase (#439). So a reboot is a `device:shutdown` followed by a `device:boot`, both

 *
 * What this hook owns is the half that did not exist: the wait between the two. The boot half needs
 * nothing new — `device:booting` unmounts the viewer and `device:ready` brings it back, which is the
