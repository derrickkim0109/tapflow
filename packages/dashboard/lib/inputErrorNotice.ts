 * What a tester is told when an input fails, keyed by the reason.

 * same rule `SESSION_ENDED_NOTICE` states in `src/pages/QASession.tsx`, and the reason a closed
 * literal union exists. `null` means the reason is shown nowhere, which is a decision per entry
 * rather than a default.
 *
 * The copy lives here and not in the agents on purpose. `message` on the wire is free prose each
 * agent owns; `reason` is the contract. Rendering `message` would make an agent's English the UI's
 * copy — unlocalisable, and written by the layer furthest from the reader. `message` is carried as
 * the description instead, where its diagnostic detail (`unknown key code: KeyFoo`) belongs.

  // gone: on the default backend `isReady()` only means "we have not closed it", so the dispatch is
  // attempted and the RPC rejects (4ms, `ECONNREFUSED`) — see `android-agent/AGENTS.md`. The protocol
  // allows one retry, and for that case a retry is free because nothing was applied. It is *not* free
  // for the narrower case of an emulator still connected but not answering, where the call times out
  // without saying whether the input landed; `android-agent` records that a retry there can double
  // the input, and that the eventual answer is a distinct "unknown, do not retry" reason rather than a
  // shorter deadline. Until that reason exists this cell cannot separate the two, so the copy stops at
  // one retry rather than inviting repeats.

  // Silent: the channel is coming up and the measured window is 186–247ms. Only standalone inputs (a
  // key, a button) are ever refused for this — a continuation frame is judged on gesture ownership
  // first — and pressing again is the instinct anyway. An error here would be noise for something
  // already fixed by the time it was read.
  'channel-starting': null,
  // Silent: the gesture this frame belonged to is gone, which happens on the first gesture after any
  // helper death because the replacement is eager. A fresh gesture normally works. The guarantee is
  // not "the next one lands" — a helper that keeps dying before it is ready refuses every terminal
  // frame — but that case exhausts the respawn budget and surfaces as `channel-unavailable`, so it
  // is bounded and ends up visible.
  'no-gesture': null,
  // **Reachable, and a first draft had this as `null` on the grounds that it was not.** The claim was that
  // this viewer only ever sends input for the session it joined, so the relay could never address it here.
  // That is true of the join and false of the reconnect: `DeviceViewer` re-sends `session:start` from an
  // effect on every `connected` edge, while the pointer handlers in the platform viewers are not gated on
  // `joined` at all — so a tap between the socket coming back and the re-join being answered is refused,
  // and a Wi-Fi blip or a laptop waking is all it takes.
  //
  // (An earlier version of this note blamed an unguarded `session:leave` stripping ownership from a mounted
  // viewer. That was true when written and stopped being true inside the same change, which widened the
  // ownership check to `session:leave` among others. The reachable path is the ordinary one above.)
  //
  // Silent here is the #426 symptom exactly — a picture that keeps updating while input stops working, with
  // nothing said. The action names re-entering the session rather than the device, because nothing about the
  // device is wrong: the frame was refused at the relay's door and never reached it.

/**
 * Resolve a wire `reason` to the copy to show and the key to dedupe on.

 * whole job is to absorb values this build does not know about — a newer agent against an older
 * dashboard — and typing it as the union would describe that case as impossible while it is exactly
 * the case being handled.
 *
 * Absence and unfamiliarity both resolve to `channel-unavailable`: absence means *unknown*, never
 * *fine* (an agent older than #490 omits the field), and the protocol's rule for a reason a consumer
 * does not recognise is the same conservative reading. Every in-repo producer now sends one — the
 * relay was the last that did not (#492) — so absence today means an older agent, nothing else. Resolving the *key* as well as the copy is what keeps two different unknown
 * reasons from stacking two identical toasts.
 *
 * `Object.hasOwn`, not `in` — `'toString' in INPUT_ERROR_NOTICE` is true, and a reason of `toString`
 * would otherwise return a function as the notice.
