 * reported screen agree, which during a fold they briefly do not — and `getBoundingClientRect()`

 * a quarter turn out — which is the flash this gate exists to suppress. That case ends on its own,
 * because the description is already on its way.
 *
 * The other direction does not. The agent also learns of a panel change from its own poll, so the
 * description can arrive with **no frame behind it** — and the emulator's capture is frame-driven,
 * so a screen that is static after a fold sends nothing at all. Hiding until the frame catches up
 * then hides forever: measured, a foldable left on "Changing posture…" until the tester touched
 * the device. A gate with no exit is the defect, whatever kept the frame away.
 *
 * So the aspect check only holds the picture back when the **frame** is the newer of the two. When

 * previous screen, which is a better answer than a placeholder that never clears.
