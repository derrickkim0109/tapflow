# .claude/

Claude Code project configuration directory.

`settings.json` and `commands/` are shared across the team and tracked in git.  
`settings.local.json` holds personal permission overrides and is listed in `.gitignore`.

## Custom commands

Invoke with `/` in Claude Code.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ai-tells {ko\|en} {detect\|rewrite} [target]` | Detect/fix AI writing tells. `detect` is the default lint/gate (not a laundering tool). External posts (HN/Reddit) = `detect` only — see the policy in [commands/ai-tells.md](./commands/ai-tells.md). |
| `/work-plan {topic}` | Create a `.work/` plan document with requirements and test cases. |
| `/deep-research {problem}` | Deep analysis of implementation, bug, or design problems using Fable 5.1. |
| `/qa {target}` | Plan and write tests for the target code. Potemkin and flaky tests prohibited. |
| `/context-sync` | Audit and fix consistency between the codebase and the context documents read before changing it — AGENTS.md, INDEX.md, `contributing/`, `.work/`. Not `docs/`; that is `/write-docs`. |
| `/compound` | Extract reusable patterns from the current session and update AGENTS.md. |
| `/promote-decision [topic]` | Promote a design decision from the private `.work/archive/` into public `contributing/`, without duplicating what is already there. Scans the whole archive when no topic is given. |
| `/release [major\|minor\|patch]` | Run the release procedure — version recommendation through release PR, via changesets. Recommends the bump itself when none is given. |
| `/write-docs {topic}` | Write a VitePress docs page — EN/KO simultaneously, sidebar registration, build verification. |

---

## settings.json vs settings.local.json

| | `settings.json` | `settings.local.json` |
|---|---|---|
| Git-tracked | Yes (team-shared) | No (gitignored) |
| Purpose | hooks, statusLine, plugins | Personal `permissions.allow` entries |
| Example | Completion notification hook | Allow `Bash(gh api *)` |

If `settings.local.json` doesn't exist, create it as an empty `{}` or omit it entirely.
