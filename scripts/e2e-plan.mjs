// Writes this release's manual E2E plan to `.work/e2e/v<version>.md`, from the two files that
// already hold everything it needs: the fixed core pass in `.internal/MANUAL-E2E-CHECKLIST.md`, and
// the changelog section `changeset version` just promoted.
//
// **Why a generated file rather than a section to edit.** The checklist's own history: 70 items, and
// eight releases (v0.15.0 → v0.20.1) went by with it run zero times. Two causes, and neither was
// discipline — there was no unit smaller than "all of it", and the release-specific section asked to
// be *rewritten* before the run, so the first move was an essay. The deciding one is that skipping
// left no trace: a skipped pass and a passed pass looked identical. A file that is absent does not.
//
// Every failure here is loud. A script that writes half a plan and exits 0 reproduces exactly the
// failure it exists to end, so a missing checklist, an unpromoted version and a core section that
// came back nearly empty all stop with a reason.
