## [0.21.0] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- **Docker is a documented way to run the relay.** The image has been on Docker Hub since 0.20.0
  and nothing in the guide said so.

### Fixed

- **android-agent**: Log unexpected scrcpy server process exits with their exit code. Expected
  exits log at debug level.

- No bold lead at all. This second sentence must not be carried into the item.

### Security

- \`js-yaml\` moved to 3.15.2.

## [0.20.1] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Something from the previous release.
