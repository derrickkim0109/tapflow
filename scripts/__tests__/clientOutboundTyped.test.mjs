// The browser-role producers construct their outbound literals directly, so typing the send function is a real
// compile-time check — unlike narrowing a relay *forward*, which checks nothing because no literal is constructed
// there (see the L4b retirement in `.work/WIRE-CONTRACT-PLAN.md`).
//
// All three are typed now, and none produced a compile error when the type went on. Worth stating plainly: **the
// value here is regression defence, not a bug found.** Every `sessionId` in these files comes from a required
// `string` parameter, so the root cause that produced 30 errors on the agent side (#509) does not exist.
//
// It matches **serialization**, not a spelling of `send(`. The first draft of this file asserted
// `/private send\(msg: BrowserToRelay\)/` and was defeated in review by the bypass its own header claimed to
// prevent: a second helper `private sendRaw(msg: RelayMsg)` writing to `this.ws` passed all seven assertions with
// tsc and the package suite green, and put `session:leaev` on the wire. `agentSendTyped.test.mjs` had already
// learned this — three of its drafts died to a renamed socket — and this file was written worse than its sibling.
//
// So the rule is the sibling's: **`JSON.stringify` appears once per file, and it serializes a parameter declared
// `BrowserToRelay` by the function enclosing it.** That constrains the sink rather than its name, so a rename
// passes and a second untyped path cannot. It also stops keying on syntactic form — `useRelay`'s send is a
// `useCallback` arrow, and a check pinned to `private send(` both missed it and would have failed on a harmless
// refactor of the other two.
//
// **"Enclosing" is resolved on the AST, not by scanning backwards for the nearest signature.** The second draft
// did scan, and review broke that too:
//
//     function send(msg: BrowserToRelay) {}
//     function sendRaw(payload: RelayMsg, audit: boolean) { socket.send(JSON.stringify(payload)) }
//
// The scan walks straight past `sendRaw`'s boundary and reports `BrowserToRelay`, because the parameter name is
// outside the pattern's allowlist. Which means the difference between caught and not caught was *what the
// parameter happened to be called* — in a file whose header disclaims exactly that brittleness. This program has
// now shipped five region parsers that did not know where their region ended, so this one uses the real one.
