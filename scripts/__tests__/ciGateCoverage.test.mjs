// `protect-main` requires a status check named `ci`. A matrix job cannot carry that name — it
// reports per-leg contexts (`test (22)`, `test (24)`) and never a plain `ci` — so the matrix lives
// in `test` and a `ci` job aggregates it.
//
// That trade has a cost worth guarding. Before it, adding a job to ci.yml meant registering the new
// context on the ruleset by hand, and forgetting was visible: the check simply was not required.
// Now a new job that nobody adds to `jobs.ci.needs` is invisible — it can go red while `ci` stays
// green and the merge is allowed. The omission moved from repo settings, where review could not see
// it, into a `needs:` line, where review *can* — but only if someone looks.
//
// `changeset` is excluded because it is separately named on the ruleset. Anything else must be
// behind the aggregate.
//
// Parsed with a narrow regex rather than a YAML library: nothing at the root resolves `yaml`, and
// adding a dependency to read one field is a worse trade than a parser that only understands the
// two-space job indentation this file actually uses. It asserts that shape first, so a reformat
// fails loudly instead of silently matching nothing.
