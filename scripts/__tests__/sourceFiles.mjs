//
// **Walked from disk, never `git ls-files`.** That listing reports tracked files only, and a file that was
// just created is exactly the state a new violation is in — so a completeness check built on it reports
// nothing about the one file it exists to look at. Measured on `agentSendTyped`: a module calling
// `ws.send(JSON.stringify(…))` planted in `packages/ios-agent/src` left all 6 tests passing while it was
// untracked, and failed the moment `git add -N` made it visible.
//
// The cost was never a bypass — pre-commit runs lint and typecheck rather than vitest, and by push time the
// file is tracked, so CI catches it. What it cost was the **local signal**: green on the machine that
// introduced the offender, red in CI, and nothing in the failure to say the two runs disagreed about which
// files existed. `clientOutboundTyped` was moved off `git` for this reason and its comment named the two
// checks still on it; this module is that fix generalised, and `checksWalkDisk.test.mjs` is what stops a
// fourth check reintroducing the pattern. See #522.

/** Directories a source-completeness check never wants. `__tests__` is here because every current caller

/** Generated trees no name can reach, because the name belongs to something real.
 *
 *  `packages/relay/public` is a copy of `packages/dashboard/dist` — the dashboard build ends with
 *  `rm -rf ../relay/public && mkdir -p ../relay/public && cp -r dist/. ../relay/public/` — so a walk
 *  that skips `dist` by name and descends into this one is applying the rule to one of two copies.
 *  `public` cannot join `SKIP_DIRS`: `docs/public` holds `robots.txt` and `llms.txt`, which
 *  `agentReadableDocs.test.mjs` asserts on by name.
 *
 *  **It also makes a walk race that build.** `dashboardFirstLoadBudget.test.mjs` runs it in the same
 *  `pnpm test:scripts` invocation, in a parallel worker, so a walker inside this directory during the
 *  `rm -rf` dies on ENOENT. One real run failed that way, and a loop measured 2 failures in 1,718
 *  walks — both at the moment the copy was replaced — against 0 after the skip.
 *
 *  Exported because two different walkers reach it: this module's `sources()` (through
 *  `clientOutboundTyped.test.mjs`, the only caller that walks all of `packages/`) and
 *  `agentReadableDocs.test.mjs`, which walks the repo root with its own extension set. Fixing one
 *  and not the other left half the race in place.
 *
 *  **`sources()` takes it as a parameter so the behaviour can be proved without touching this
 *  directory.** A first version of that test planted a file inside `packages/relay/public` — which
 *  is to say, it reproduced the race it exists to prevent: the build's `rm -rf` can land between the
 *  `mkdirSync` and the `writeFileSync`, and a cleanup that removes the directory recursively can
 *  delete the tree the build just wrote. The probe runs in a temp tree under `scripts/` instead, for
 *  the reason `checksWalkDisk.test.mjs` already gives about where probes belong. */

 * `packages/ios-agent/src/__tests__` and `packages/mcp-server/src/__tests__`, `checksWalkDisk` makes temp trees
 * under `scripts/__tests__` — and vitest runs files in parallel, so a walker that lists one and then reads it
 * died on ENOENT about nothing. Measured: `protocolPayloadTypes` and `agentReadableDocs` each failed this way
 * (2 of 12 full runs under CPU load). Skipping by path is what this file did for `packages/relay/public`, and
 * it holds only for the paths someone has already been bitten by; a removed file is not part of the tree by
 * definition, so these skip it wherever it is. Any other error still throws.
