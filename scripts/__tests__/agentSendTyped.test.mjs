// An agent's outbound literal is the one place in the wire contract the compiler could not see. The relay
// forwards with `JSON.stringify(msg)`, so a reply is never re-created by anything typed, and an agent used
// to hand its literal straight to `ws.send`. #489 (an agent answering nobody) and #490 (a missing `reason`)
// both came out of that gap, and `inputErrorReason.test.mjs` exists because a script had to stand in for a
// compiler.
//
// L4a closed it with two typed helpers per agent. This file's only job is that nothing goes **around** them.
//
// It matches **serialization**, not a spelling of `.send`. Three earlier drafts of this check were bypassed
// in review by renaming the socket: `streamWs.send(JSON.stringify(…))` and `const alias = this.ws;
// alias?.send(…)` both walked past a pattern keyed on `this.ws`, and the first is not hypothetical —
// `streamWs` is in scope in `startBinaryStream`, and the relay dispatches a text frame from a stream socket
// through the same agent cases. `const p = JSON.stringify(m); alias?.send(p)` defeated it too.
//
// So the rule is: in a file that writes to a socket, `JSON.stringify` appears only inside a send helper.
// Binary frames do not serialize, and files that stringify for other reasons (shell quoting in
// `DeviceChromeLoader`) never touch `.send(`.
