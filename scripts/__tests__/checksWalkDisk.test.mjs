// #522. Three static checks asked git which files exist. `git ls-files` reports **tracked** files only, and a
// file that was just created is exactly the state a new violation is in — so each of those checks was blind to
// the one file it existed to look at. Measured on `agentSendTyped`: an offender planted in
// `packages/ios-agent/src` left all 6 of its tests passing while untracked, and failed the moment `git add -N`
// made it visible.
//
// Fixing the three instances is worth less than this file, because the pattern is what recurs: asking git is
// the obvious way to enumerate a package, it reads as more authoritative than a directory walk, and the hole
// it opens is invisible — the check goes green.
//
// The cost was never a bypass, and saying so plainly matters for judging this: pre-commit runs lint and
// typecheck rather than vitest, and by push time the file is tracked, so CI catches it. What was lost is the
// local signal — green on the machine that introduced the offender, red in CI, and nothing in the failure to
// say the two runs disagreed about which files existed.
//
// **The first version of this guard was defeated four ways in review**, and each defeat shaped an assertion
// below rather than being patched where it landed:
//
//  1. It scanned only `*.test.mjs` at the top of `scripts/__tests__`. Moving the git call into a sibling
//     helper module put it out of reach — and this change *created* that idiom by adding `sourceFiles.mjs`,
//     so the next person writes `trackedFiles.mjs`. One new file plus one changed import reopened the hole
//     with all three tests green.
//  2. Its regex required a quote on each side of the literal, so `` execSync(`git ls-files ${pkg}`) `` and
//     `'git ls-files ' + pkg` walked past it, as did `git ls-tree -r HEAD --name-only`, which lists tracked
//     files without containing the string at all.
//  3. `readdirSync` does not recurse, while vitest's include is `scripts/__tests__/**/*.test.mjs`. A check in
//     a subdirectory was run by vitest and unknown to the guard.
//  4. (Not a defeat of this file, but found with it.) The extraction had quietly dropped `.d.ts` from the
//     walk — see `sourceFiles.mjs`.
