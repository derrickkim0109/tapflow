// The decision half of `.claude/hooks/comment-card-gate.sh`. Reads the PreToolUse payload on stdin,
// exits 0 to allow and 2 to block.
//
// **PreToolUse, not Stop.** The sibling prose gate runs at Stop, which is right for a file — you can
// still edit it. A comment is public the moment the command runs, so the only stage where a check
// can change anything is before it.

// `.internal/`, not `.work/`. That directory is dated work logs — `YYYY-MM-DD-{topic}-{type}.md`
// per its own CLAUDE.md — and the card is a standing register, not a log of anything. It sits
// with the other local-only operating documents. Both directories are gitignored, so a
// contributor's checkout has neither and the gate stays off for them either way.
//
// **Moving it is a two-file change with a silent failure mode**: `judge` returns `blocked: false`
// when the card is absent, so a path that points at nothing turns the gate off rather than
// breaking it. `commentCardGate.test.mjs` builds a throwaway checkout, puts the card where this
// constant says, and runs the hook — pointing this back at `.work/` turns that suite red.

for this reader as an issue instead.
