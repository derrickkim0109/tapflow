// Judges every entry in root `pnpm.overrides`: is it still needed, is it correct, does it reach
// production.
//
// Why: the block is hand-maintained, security-critical, and nothing validates it (#472). Measured
// on 2026-08-06, all fourteen entries were inert — removing the whole block and resolving cold
// produced a byte-identical tree — and six were also wrong. Nobody had asked, because there was no
// way to ask.
//
// The keys go wrong for one repeatable reason. Both #469 and #471 derived a key from the Dependabot
// ALERT, which reports only the range matching the version you happen to have installed. `fast-uri`
// had three affected ranges patched within fourteen minutes of each other; the alert showed one,
// and the key that came out of it left the current major line unguarded. So this reads the
// advisory's full affected set instead, which is the whole point of the correctness check.
//
// Usage: pnpm overrides:audit [--json]
//
// This script REWRITES `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` while it works and restores them from
// git. It refuses to start unless both are clean, so a crash can never lose uncommitted work and
// recovery is `git checkout --` rather than a backup file it might fail to write.
