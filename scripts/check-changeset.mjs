//
// Why: between v0.16.0 and v0.17.0 four PRs (#410–#413) changed shipped code with no changeset
// between them, and the omission only surfaced while preparing the release. The rule was written
// down in CONTRIBUTING.md and nothing enforced it, so the release notes would have announced the
// clipboard bridge and stayed silent on the four fixes underneath it.
//
// Usage: node scripts/check-changeset.mjs <base-ref>   (default: origin/main)
//
// Opting out: put `<!-- no-changeset: reason -->` in the PR body, or pass --reason "…" locally.
// A comment-only or test-only change is a legitimate skip; the point is that skipping is a
// decision someone writes down, not something that happens by forgetting.
