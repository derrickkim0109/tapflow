/**
 * What ties the committed network-filter `.app` to the sources it was built from.
 *
 * The extension is signed and notarized on a maintainer's Mac and committed as a binary, because
 * ad-hoc signing does not load and the signing key deliberately does not live in CI. That leaves one
 * failure this repo can actually catch: **someone edits the Swift and forgets to rebuild**, and a
 * release ships a binary that does not match its own sources.
 *
 * **Recording the source hash alone would not catch it.** The person who forgets the rebuild forgets
 * the hash too, both values stay consistent with each other, and the check passes — it would only
 * catch someone who updated the record deliberately, which is the person who did not forget. So the
 * record carries the artifact's hash as well, and `build.sh` writes both in the same step that
 * produces the artifact.
 *
 * What it does **not** claim, and the list is worth reading before trusting this:
 *
 * - that the committed binary was built from the committed sources — nothing here can say that;
 * - the signing **authority** — who signed it. That would need `codesign`, which is macOS-only while
 *   this runs on the CI's Linux. What it does now record is the extension's embedded provisioning
 *   profile (#728), which is a file in the bundle and readable anywhere; an ad-hoc bundle carries none
 *   and no longer satisfies this identically, but a Developer ID other than ours would.
 *
 * It says the two trees were recorded together and that neither has changed since. `project.pbxproj`
 * is deliberately not an input: `xcodegen` rewrites it on every build with fresh identifiers, so
 * hashing it would report a change for every build and nothing else.

/**
 * **The two halves, and why the line falls where it does** (#724).
 *
 * `build.sh` stamps one version into both `Info.plist`s, so a rebuild that changed only `Host/`
 * still bumps the extension and macOS performs a replace — measured, three of the six filter
 * rebuilds so far. Splitting the version needs a way to ask "did the *extension* change", which is
 * what these two lists are for.
 *
 * **Everything in the repo that is not `Host/` counts as an extension input**, `project.yml` and
 * `build.sh` included. Both change what the extension binary is without touching a line of Swift —
 * signing flags, the hardened runtime, the entitlements — and an extension that changed without its
 * version changing is replaced **silently** by macOS, which is the failure `project.yml` warns about
 * in capitals. Within the repo the boundary is therefore drawn to be wrong in the direction that
 * costs an unnecessary replace rather than a skipped one.
 *
 * **It is repo files only, and that limit is now load-bearing rather than incidental.** The shipped
 * sysext also embeds a provisioning profile and a Developer ID signature that come from the
 * maintainer's Mac, and it is built by whatever Xcode is installed. Renewing the extension's
 * provisioning profile — an annual event — changes the shipped binary with no file here moving, so
 * the version would be reused and macOS would skip the replace on every Mac that already has it.
 * Before this split that blind spot was harmless: an unwatched input still took a fresh epoch. It is
 * not harmless now, which is why `build.sh` takes `FORCE_EXT_BUMP=1` and why detecting it
 * automatically is tracked separately.
 *
 * **`Host/`'s signing surface is a decision rather than a gap.** Nesting is one-way — the host seals
 * the extension's four files and the extension seals only its own profile — so re-signing the host
 * leaves the extension bundle byte-identical, and there is nothing to re-activate. The host app is
 * replaced on every release anyway, because its version rises on every build. What would matter is a
 * change of signing *identity*, and that reissues the extension's own provisioning profile:
 * `TeamIdentifier` and `DeveloperCertificates` are inside it, so the comparison below sees it.
