 * - **A field does not mean a write.** "To send the parameters as a `GET` query string instead, use
 *   `--method GET`" — so `--method GET … -f per_page=100` is a *read*, and blocking it blocks the
 *   first thing the card asks for. Only a field named `body` is a body.
 * - An explicit write method counts on its own, since a `POST` to a comments path is one whatever
